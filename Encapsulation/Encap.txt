Encapsulation is the technique of hiding the implementation details of a class from the outside world, 
and only exposing a public interface for interacting with the class.

Encapsulation enables you to develop robust software 
because you set the appropriate access boundaries to class data from calling code.

It gives you better control of class attributes and methods, 
and the option to make certain members read or write only. 

This fine-tuning of access to class data helps to ensure that your code is of higher quality 
and easier to maintain.
